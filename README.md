# MERN-Stack-Projects
Here you'll find all my MERN Stack Projects which I had made during my journey.<br>
<h2>Mini Project</h2>
<p>=>This project is based on Node js and Express js.<br>
  =>I have created a backend server of signup,login and forget password<br>
  =>In the signup section user will give the required information. The information will get stored in the database<br>
  =>In the login section the username and password are been asked and the server will check the credentials wheather they are correctly typed or not based on that user will be given access with the generated jwt token.<br>
  =>In the forget page the user must enter his username to get his password. if the username is invalid password is also not shown</p>
